# BookTools

BookTools is a simple python program that counts the number of words in a given text file.

## Installation

This works with Python 3.10 and Pygame 2.4.0 . You can install Pygame through the python package manager.

## Usage

Put the texts you want to scan through in the "texts" folder, in .txt format. Upon running the program, it should show a GUI with the names of all the text files found in the folder (press up and down arrow key to scroll through them). Click on the text file you wish to scan.
Once the words have been scanned through, click one of the words to hide it.
